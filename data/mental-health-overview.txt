Mental health refers to emotional, psychological, and social well-being. In Rwanda, depression, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders are common, especially after the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.

Common symptoms:
- Persistent sadness or hopelessness
- Difficulty sleeping or concentrating
- Feeling anxious, panicked, or restless
- Loss of interest in daily activities

Healthy coping strategies:
1. Talk to someone you trust â€” friend, family, or counselor.
2. Practice relaxation techniques: deep breathing, meditation, prayer.
3. Stay physically active: exercise improves mood.
4. Avoid alcohol or drug abuse.
5. Seek professional help when needed.
